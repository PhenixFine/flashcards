Stage 7 of 7 for JetBrains Academy Kotlin [Flashcards project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/83/stages/463/implement).
The program allows the user to create flashcards with terms and definitions, remove flashcards, import and export the flashcards, test the user on the flashcards, keep track of mistakes, reset the mistakes, and save the session log to a file. In the requirements below, I included a snap shot of the stage six requirments, as there wasn't much to do for stage seven.
